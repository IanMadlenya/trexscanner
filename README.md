# Micro Trades Scanner for Bittrex

__This is still a WIP, i'm working on a clean better version of the scanner.__
You can use as is at your own risk.

The scanner basically runs through all coins on Bittrex that are trading with volume above 100 BTC, for liquidity, and alerting the ones that pass the indicators.

Better documentation will follow the final version.
